# React-Starter

Makes it very easy to get hacking on new react code featuring [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:danielberndt/react-starter.git my-project
cd my-project
npm install && npm start
```

Done! Now hit `http://localhost:8080/` and you're ready to start hacking.
